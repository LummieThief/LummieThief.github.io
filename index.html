          <br>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm Joseph Cook ("Joey" casually and "LummieThief" online),
                I use he/him pronouns, and I'm an indie game developer from Richland, WA.
                I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University
                of Washington in Seattle and am looking to turn game development
                into a career.
                <br><br>
                I love both making and playing games, and my favorite games tend
                to be team focused multiplayer games, brutally difficult games, and
                exploration games. That being said, it might not surprise you to
                hear some of my favorites are Outer Wilds, Spelunky 2, Deep Rock Galactic,
                Risk of Rain 2, League of Legends, and Minecraft.
                <br><br>
                I'm also a big fan of board games and have quite a large collection,
                with my favorites being Galaxy Trucker, Secret Hitler, Cockroach Poker,
                and The Search For Planet X.
                <br><br>
                In my free time I like to play games with my friends, work on personal
                projects, go running, listen to music, or solve puzzles. Puzzle
                solving is probably my favorite activity, and I think that's part of what
                drew me to game development, because as Mark Brown from Game Maker's
                Toolkit puts it: "Programming is basically the best puzzle game in the world."
