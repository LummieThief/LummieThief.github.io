                        Worm Adventure 4: Into the Wormhole is my proudest game to date
                        and is currently available on Steam after 14 months of solo-development
                        and another couple months after launch fixing bugs and tweaking
                        level design based on real user feedback. It was my first project
                        in Unity and started out as a parody of my first ever game,
                        Worm Adventure 2, but it was just so fun to play and work on
                        that I couldn't stop making it bigger and bigger until I had
                        a commercial game on my hands. Most of the time invested went
                        into learning Unity, designing levels, and tweaking the
                        character controller until it felt perfect. The grappling hook
                        was implemented on the second week of development but was completely
                        rewritten from scratch 6 times over the next year until
                        I got something that worked the way I wanted.

                        Dice of Life began as an idea for an artificial life simulation
                        like John Conway's Game of Life where the organisms are
                        all six-sided dice which would perform different actions
                        based on which face they rolled. So, when the theme for
                        the Game Maker's Toolkit 2022 Game Jam was announced to be
                        Roll of the Dice, I instantly knew what I was going to do.
                        A simulation without a win condition, lose condition, or
                        really any player interaction at all wouldn't perform well
                        in a game jam, so I took my original idea and turned it into
                        a puzzle game where you have to build the dice yourself instead
                        of having them evolve, and it lead to some really cool immergent
                        mechanics that I was able to make into puzzles. There are some
                        levels that could have used more playtesting and a lot of mechanics
                        were left on the cutting room floor, but I'm overall satisfied with the result.

                    <td>
                        Clean Up Fiasco is my most recent project and was my first
                        time working in a team larger than 2 on a game jam. All
                        three of us had slightly different ideas of what the game
                        was going to be, so the design phase of development was
                        challenging, but over a couple hours of discussion and
                        design doc-ing we were able to reach a middle ground that
                        we were all happy with, and came up with an idea that none
                        of us would have come up with individually. This had me out
                        of my comfort zone a little bit working on something I don't
                        think I would have made on my own, so it was a great learning
                        experience. I primarily
                        worked on the dirt system, which utilizes Unity's DrawMeshInstanced
                        function to draw tens of thousands of interactable dirt
                        particles on screen, which all get stored in a
                        data structure I put together in order to be able to randomly
                        access any particle in constant time while keeping memory
                        overhead low. This is what took most of my time, but I also
                        worked on enemy AI, environment art, sound design, and menus.

            <h2>Croquet Climb <span class="date">&nbsp;(2022, Unity)</span></h2>
            <table><tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        Croquet Climb was my submission to Ludwig's Foddian Game
                        Jam and I had the idea of a game where you try to roll a
                        ball up a hill. In order to prevent the player from being
                        super safe and going really slow, which isn't any fun, I
                        added a shot limit to encourage the player to take risks.
                        The problem was then the question of what to do when the
                        player runs out of shots. In the original version I submitted,
                        the game ended when you ran out of shots, but that turned
                        out to be a poor decision. Sending the player back to the
                        start was punishing them based on their past mistakes which
                        doesn't feel fair to the player and can leave them in a
                        situation where they purposely restart because their run
                        is hopeless. To try to solve this, I updated the game to
                        make you take an uncontrollable shot when you run out, which
                        still punishes the player for playing safe, but gives
                        the player control over how much progress they lose when they run out of shots
                        and decreases the influence of their past actions as long
                        as they can perform well in the current situation.

                        I worked on this game together with a friend I met in Game
                        Dev Club my first year there, and it was the most fun I've ever
                        had working on a project! It's all based off of an Eric Andre
                        comedy sketch, and we were able to reflect that not only in
                        sound effects and music ripped straight from the video,
                        but also in the game design. Everything is designed to be
                        super chaotic, from the truck drifting on every turn and
                        flying into the air if you hit a curb, to the pizza balls
                        in the passenger seat bouncing around the cabin and covering
                        up your tablet. The game also has a surprising amount of depth,
                        since your right window has to be rolled up to keep the
                        pizza balls in the truck, so you have to throw everything
                        out of the left window. This not only adds to the chaos by
                        making you have to constantly look back and forth to grab
                        pizza balls and throw them out the window, but also makes
                        you have to plan your route through the neighboorhood more
                        carefully so you pass the house you're aiming for on the left.

                    <td>
                        Galaxy Trucktris was the first game I made after leaving
                        for college and joining the game development club there,
                        and is also non-coincidentally the last game I made in
                        Gamemaker before making the leap to Unity. The
                        theme for the jam was simply "retro" so I decided to try
                        to take my own spin on the classic game Tetris by combining
                        it with a board game I really love called Galaxy Trucker.
                        Tetris and Galaxy Trucker are both tried and true fun, and
                        they meshed together really well since the randomness and
                        time pressure of Tetris fullfils the exact same purpose as
                        the pile of parts and hourglass in Galaxy Trucker, so it
                        was basically guaranteed to be fun. Even though I was still
                        pretty inexperienced back when I made this game, it's still
                        one of my go-to games to show at showcases since everyone
                        instantly knows how to play because everyone knows Tetris.

                        One of my favorite games I used to play with my brothers is an old Xbox
                        360 arcade game called 20 Games To Play With Your Mates, and our favorite game in
                        the collection was Astro Pods. In the game you have to try
                        to land your ship on different landing pads, but only one
                        person can land on the one worth the most points so you
                        would have to fight for it. After a couple rounds of
                        play it would always devolve into an all out battle
                        where nobody cared about trying to land their ship and only
                        tried to get everyone else killed by slamming into them at high speed.
                        Astro Pods was only available on Xbox 360 and I wanted to
                        play it at school with my friends on the school computers,
                        so I just made it myself. I focused more on the pvp aspect
                        by making it so you can never land, and added infinite
                        terrain generation so that it wouldn't get stale. This is another game that
                        I still like to showcase because of its simplicity, humor, and
                        local multiplayer.

                        Worm Adventure 2 is the first game I ever published online.
                        You might be wondering why it's called Worm Adventure 2 if
                        it's the first game, and the answer is simply that Worm Adventure
                        is too boring of a name, so I slapped a 2 onto the end of it.
                        This game took me 2 weeks to complete, and apart from the copyrighted Nintendo assets,
                        lack of menus, flat visuals, and being locked in a set-size window without the
                        option for fullscreen, it's not that bad for a first
                        attempt. The basic idea was good enough to be made into a fully
                        fledged commercial release in its sequel, Worm Adventure 4,
                        so I'm pretty proud of past me (even if I still had a lot to learn).
